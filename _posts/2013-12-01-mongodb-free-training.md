title : MongoDB free training
---


I just got my second certificate for the two MongoDB courses I was interested in – Python and DBA.

I do highly suggest it to everybody – it’s relatively simple. I would say that DBA course is much simpler in the homework/exam. So the fact that I took time to study for Python course helped quite a bit with DBA course.

Keep in mind that as other courses I took ( [https://www.coursera.org/](https://www.coursera.org/) ) the courses with MongoDB are time-sensitive. You have to get some time to finish the assignments by 9PM EST on Monday. For most people this will mean spending 2-4 hours during the weekend. Also, since they are time-sensitive  the courses don’t run all the time – you have to start on certain date.

But on the plus side, the forum is very lively while the course is running – both students and MongoDB support are answering questions and giving suggestions. That was a big help.

Also, general exposure to NoSQL ideas would help – your head may spin a little less.  I really found it quite amusing that sharding was not major part of dev course – why else would you pick NoSQL?
